/**
 * Metadata about the Item.
 * @param itemId The Plaid Item ID. The `item_id` is always unique; linking the same account at the
 * same institution twice will result in two Items with different `item_id` values. Like all Plaid
 * identifiers, the `item_id` is case-sensitive.
 * @param institutionId The Plaid Institution ID associated with the Item. Field is `null` for Items
 * created via Same Day Micro-deposits.
 * @param webhook The URL registered to receive webhooks for the Item.
 * @param error We use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our
 * errors are further classified by `error_type`. In general, 200 HTTP codes correspond to success, 40X
 * codes are for developer- or user-related failures, and 50X codes are for Plaid-related issues.
 * Error fields will be `null` if no error has occurred.
 * @param availableProducts A list of products available for the Item that have not yet been
 * accessed.
 * @param billedProducts A list of products that have been billed for the Item. Note -
 * `billed_products` is populated in all environments but only requests in Production are billed.
 *
 * @param consentExpirationTime The RFC 3339 timestamp after which the consent provided by the end
 * user will expire. Upon consent expiration, the item will enter the `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error
 * state. To circumvent the `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error and maintain continuous consent, the end user
 * can reauthenticate via Linkâ€™s update mode in advance of the consent expiration time.
 *
 * Note - This is only relevant for European institutions subject to PSD2 regulations mandating a
 * 90-day consent window. For all other institutions, this field will be null.
 *
 * @param updateType Indicates whether an Item requires user interaction to be updated, which can be
 * the case for Items with some forms of two-factor authentication.
 *
 * `background` - Item can be updated in the background
 *
 * `requires_user_authentication` - Item requires user interaction to be updated
